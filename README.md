# Q. Quarterly Inc.
**Foreseeing Future Returns, With Just A Timeframe & Company Name**

# The Project 
We have now reached the end of the program! To "showcase" the skills we have obtained during our time here at the Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp, we have put together "a professional-level data science project" using our own choice of data. 


# The Goal 
The goal of this data analysis was to use the 10-Q reports of companies to conduct a sentiment analysis. Based off of the language of the documents one would be able to make a prediction on the future returns of the companies (negative ruturns or positive returns).
